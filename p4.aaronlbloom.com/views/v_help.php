 				<br>
 				TaskReq is a customizable requirements documentation app. The goal is to provide a web app with a simple UI where you can enter requirmenets 
 				for work to be done. 
 				A task consists of a common set of header information such as a name and description and a dynamic number of detail sections. 
 				While modifying a task you can set what types of details you wish to set (requirements, assumptions, sql code) and 
 				how many items under each detail section you wish to add. 
 				
 				<br><br>
 				Not only is each task customizable in terms of adding/removing sections and components, the application itself is customizable. The following aspects of the application are all customizable at application setup to meet your needs, they are based on setup data stored in database tables, not hardcoded values:
 				<ul>
 					<li><b>Task Type's</b> (such as Application, Report or UI)</li>
 					<li><b>Change Type's</b> (such as New, Change or Defect)</li>
 					<li><b>Statuses</b> (such as Open, in progress or closed)</li>
 					<li><b>Detail Section Types</b> (such as Requirements or Assumptions)</li>
 					<li><b>Custom Header Fields</b> - there are 10 custom fields in the header section that can be named in a table</li>
 				</ul>
