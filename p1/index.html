									<p>
										 I have spent the past 15 years as a a software developer and business analyst with <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com"> Hachette Book Group</a>, a major book publishing company.

									</p>
								 Tools:
									 <p>
										 I am currently using the text editor <a href="http://textpad.com/">TextPad</a>, ftp client <a href="http://www.cuteftp.com/">CuteFTP</a>, local test server
										 <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a> and source control manager <a href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a>.
